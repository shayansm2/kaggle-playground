Are there other transformations that we need to know?”\\nDmitry\\nI can think of the Box Cox transformation. There are certain types of transformations of the target variable, especially in the regression tasks. You have to make it more randomly distributed, for example. For sure, you can leave it like that, but the results, especially in a linear model because linear models really depend on the linearity, or the normal distribution of the target variable, so the results can be not very good.\\xa0\\nFor sure, throughout the course of the Zoomcamp, we will talk about the nonlinear methods such as end symbols, for example, end there. You can see that, for example, you can use it without transformation – using the trees.\\nAlexey\\nYeah, thanks. “Cox Box transformation” you said?

Then come data modeling concepts, because keep in mind that you have to focus a lot on transforming that data to be lighter use. Then it's very important that you know how to transform the data. Then, you would need to know some BI – being able to expose that data later on to some BI tools.\\xa0\\nThis doesn't mean that you need to focus on building dashboards or things like that, but at least know how that data could be used from a business perspective. Once you have that, then it’s also important to know concepts around data warehousing – at least know the parts of the ETL, ELT, all of these concepts. Know how the data gets to the data warehouse and be able to understand that to kind of cover both parts. It would be very important.\",\n",
